## Problem

Yandex GO is one of the top three ride-hailing services in the world. Our app facilitates over 4 billion trips per year across 32 countries. We are committed to the quality of our services, ensuring thorough checks of drivers and their vehicles before they go online based on dozens of criteria. Part of the vehicle inspection process is carried out remotely using vehicle photos, allowing us to block or grant the driver access to orders. This tool ensures that cars do not go online if they are damaged or dirty.

Computer vision algorithms play a significant role in this remote quality control process. Machine learning acts as a filter that processes vehicle inspection requests, automatically approving a portion of requests that contain no violations according to the predictions and sending suspicious cases for additional manual review.

### How does the photo inspection process work?
As part of vehicle photo inspections, drivers periodically receive a task to take photos of their car so it can be checked for damage, compliance with service standards, branding presence, etc. Before these checks, we also need to ensure that drivers took the photos honestly and sent what we expected. The driver is required to take 4 photos (front, rear, left side, right side). The photos are taken through the Yandex PRO app, which has an interface that guides them to capture the 4 photos in the correct order and from the required angles.

In the standard process, the photos are first reviewed by ML. If the algorithm finds nothing suspicious in the photos, the inspection is automatically approved. If any model flags at least one photo, the inspection is sent to an assessor for a final decision. Thus, the object for decision-making is the inspection itself, i.e., all four photos together.

In this task, the license plate numbers have been blacked out.

## Data: 
Competition data is organized as follows:
- training photos are on the [Yandex Disk](https://disk.yandex.ru/d/EUgS6vJyqYn_uA), [S3 storage](https://plcn.s3.yandex.net/aidao24/competition_photo_mid.tar.gz) and HSE HPC cluster under `/tmp/cs/competition_photo_mid` (fast read operations) and `/opt/software/datasets/cs/competition_photo_mid` (backup just in case).
- training photos descriptions `public_description.csv` is on the [GitHub](https://github.com/atolstikov/aidao24/blob/main/baseline_solution/public_description.csv).
- Also on GitHub there is [baseline solution](https://github.com/atolstikov/aidao24/tree/main/baseline_solution) for you to start off.

`public_description.csv` contains following columns:
- **filename** —  name of the photo file, consisting of `pass_id` and `plan_side`.
- **pass_id** — ID of the inspection. Each inspection contains 4 photos.
- **plan_side** — the side of the vehicle that should be in the photo. Possible values: front, back, left, right.
- **fact_side** — the side of the vehicle as determined by assessors. Possible values: front, back, left, right, unknown.
- **fraud_verdict** — the assessor's verdict on what is depicted in the photo. Possible values:
   - ALL_GOOD —  the photo clearly shows one side of the vehicle, which is fully visible and in focus.
   - LACK_OF_PHOTOS — the photo does not contain a vehicle at all.
   - BLURRY_PHOTO — the photo is blurry.
   - SCREEN_PHOTO — not a real vehicle photo, but a photo of a screen.
   - DARK_PHOTO — the photo is too dark.
   - INCOMPLETE_CAPTURE — the vehicle is not fully visible in the photo.
- **fraud_probability** — the proportion of assessors who have assigned the given fraud_verdict. If no verdict achieves a majority, a random one is chosen.
- **damage_verdict** — the assessor's verdict on the vehicle's condition. Possible values:
   - NO_DEFECT —  no visible damage.
   - DEFECT — there is some damage.
   - BAD_PHOTO — nothing can be said about the damage because of the photo quality.
- **damage_probability** — the proportion of assessors who assigned the given damage_verdict. If no verdict achieves a majority, a random one is chosen.

## Objective

To propose an ML approach to assess the quality of photos and vehicle conditions automatically:  
1. For detecting fraud (incorrect photos, unclear images, or incorrect photo sets).  
2. For detecting vehicle damage.


## Performance Metric 
Each examination includes 2 targets and 4 sides of a vehicle. But after all, we need to predict whether the inspection should be sent to a human for review to provide feedback to the driver or if there are no defects and it can be automatically approved. This means that the metric is calculated not for individual photos for each target but for the inspection as a whole.

*Evaluation Metric:* ROC AUC (object — inspection)

## Deliverables
*Required Deliverables*:
- Model Weights: The trained model's weights for reproducibility and further analysis.
- Executable Script: A script containing all necessary code to run the model, including data reading, preprocessing steps, model architecture, and inference code.

*What to submit to contest*:
- A single zip archive containing `Makefile` with mandatory `prepare` and `run` instructions. The `prepare` instruction is to be used when setting up extra libraries or some cache warm-up; notice that competition data is not exposed at this moment. The `run` instruction is the primary instruction that produces predictions for your model (namely, `predictions.csv`). At this stage, private images are linked to a working directory under the path `private_test/<filename>` (analogous to provided training data), and the overall private dataset description has the path `private_description.csv` (which only has columns `filename`, `pass_id`, `plan_side`).
Example of such configuration:
  - `Makefile` — the Makefile to build and run your application in the form:
    ```
    prepare:
        python -m pip install -e <code of some library you brought>
    run:
        python run.py
    ```
  - `run.py` — the main script to run the model.
Also, please submit the training code (include it in the zip archive described above) and other necessary files to reproduce your solution, particularly to obtain the weights checkpoint. It would be easier for us if this training code were nicely organized in a separate folder.
- **IMPORTANT.** Your script should output a csv file `predictions.csv` with predictions for the private dataset (columns `pass_id`, `prediction`).
